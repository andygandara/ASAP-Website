                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <h4>About the Executive Director</h4>
                <h5>Professional Background</h5>
                <p>Dr. Armando A. Rodriguez joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at Arizona State University (ASU) in 1990 – after receiving his doctorate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His area of specialization was control design for complex dynamical systems. He has worked/consulted at/for Army Research Laboratory, Boeing, Eglin Air Force Base, Honeywell, IBM, Bell Laboratories, MIT, National Academies, NSF, NASA Ames, NASA Langley, Raytheon Missile Systems. He has authored over 200 publications – including three texts: Analysis and Design of Feedback Control Systems, Analysis and Design of Linear Systems, and Analysis and Design of Multivariable Control Systems. He has given over 70 invited talks – including over 10 plenary talks.</p>
                <h5>Personal Biographical Background</h5>
                <p>His parents migrated to the U.S. in search of financial opportunity. He was born and raised in Washington Heights, New York City – a multicultural neighborhood bordering Harlem on its north side. Rodriguez is the oldest of three boys. His father was a window cleaner and handyman. His mother stayed home to take care of her three boys. His mother would pass away of cancer at the age of 44. Rodriguez was 13 years old. His brothers were 5 and 6 years old. This traumatic experience motivated him to excel in his studies. He is married to a lovely, hardworking accomplished engineer – the daughter of migrant field workers. Together, they are the proud parents of twins – a boy and a girl; great students; great kids; eager to become engineers so that they can create.</p>
                <h5>Awards</h5>
                <p>He is the recipient of an 1998 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Engineering Mentoring – receiving the award from President Bill Clinton in a White House oval office ceremony. He is also a Boeing A.D. Welliver Fellow (1996). He has received multiple teach and mentoring awards. He is currently the Executive Director of the Southwest Institute for Engineering Transfer Excellence (SWIETE) and the Motivated Engineering Transfer Student (METS) Center. He is working, with partners, toward the establishment of an Arizona-Wide and Southwest Regional Engineering Transfer Excellence Academy. Partnering institutions include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mesa Community College, Estrella Mountain Community College, Phoenix College</li>
                    <li>Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, Mohave Community College, Yavapai College</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Research Areas</h5>
                <p>His research interests lie in the following areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nonlinear control theory; robust control of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems; infinite-dimensional systems; approximation theory; sampled data systems; multi-rate systems; nonlinear systems with hard constraints; nonlinear and convex optimization</li>
                    <li>How to best motivate, recruit, empower, train and place engineering students; working with community colleges across Arizona and the Southwest to maximally recruit and impact engineering bound students; toward an effective theory of quiz-based and project-based learning for STEM students, academic success and professional development (ASAP) strategies for engineering students – particularly community college transfer students</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Application Areas</h5>
                <p>Application areas have included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Intelligent autonomous systems and vehicles; driverless vehicles; robotic systems; drones; interacting systems; hypersonic vehicle design and control; guidance, navigation and control (GNC) for missiles; spacecraft design and control; power converters; lower power electronics; coordination of multiple ground and air vehicles in a highly uncertain environment; Modeling, Simulation, Animation and Real-Time (MoSART) control of dynamical systems; Flexible Autonomous Machines operating in an uncertain Environment (FAME); renewable energy; sustainability; and infrastructure management.<br/>
                            With students, he founded ASU’s Micro-Air Vehicle (MAV) club in 2015. He REALLY loves his job!</li>
                    <li>“When I was growing up in New York, I could never have possibly imagined all the opportunities that I would one day have. No way! My father gave me two choices: study or die. I am glad that eventually I chose correctly. My dad was glad too. Thanks dad! I owe so much to my mentors and teachers. I am supremely and forever grateful. Being able to give back is just one more gift that I could not have imagined.”</li>
                </ul>
