                    <div>
                      <p>We all know that engineers play a significant role in shaping the world we live in. Engineers are responsible (in part) for the ongoing technological revolution that the world is experiencing.</p>
                      <p>Without engineers, many (if not most) of the technology we use day-in and day-out would not exist.</p>
                      <p>Engineers are critical toward achieving and maintaining a high standard of living. As technology continues to advance, we expect living standards around the world to significantly improve. Billions should benefit from this advance.</p>
                      <p>Engineers are innovators that discover and design ways to significantly enhance all areas of people's lives. These areas include advanced:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Transportation systems</li>
                          <li>Communication systems</li>
                          <li>Computer systems</li>
                          <li>Health and medical diagnostic and surgical systems</li>
                          <li>Personalized medicine</li>
                          <li>Clean energy solutions</li>
                          <li>Environmental solutions</li>
                          <li>Automation</li>
                          <li>Robotic systems</li>
                          <li>Mass asynchronous learning environments</li>
                          <li>Air, land, sea, and cyber defense systems</li>
                          <li>Space and underwater exploration systems</li>
                        </ul>
                        And much more.
                      </p>
                      <p>Engineers make our lives easier, safer and better.</p>
                      <p>Engineers create technology, infrastructure, processes, materials, devices and systems that we use every day. Engineers are responsible for the development of many "products." These include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Medical devices that save lives (e.g. pace makers, defibrillators, medicine dispensers, artificial limbs and organs)</li>
                          <li>Communication/computing devices and systems (e.g. smart cell phones, powerful desktop and laptop computers, PDAs, the internet)</li>
                          <li>Advanced transportation systems (e.g. hybrid vehicles, magnetically levitated trains, hypersonic aircraft)</li>
                          <li>Advanced robotic systems (e.g. on manufacturing lines, for delicate surgical procedures)</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>Engineers have dramatically shaped the world. Here's some of their major accomplishments:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Computers</li>
                          <li>The Internet</li>
                          <li>Spacecraft</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>In just the last 100 years, many revolutionary changes have taken place. During this short period, we've gone from primitive communications to instant world wide multimedia communications; airplanes that fly 40 mph to airplanes that fly 10 times the speed of sound (<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/x43-main.html" target="_blank">link to X-43A Mach 10 Flight</a>) - a truly amazing feat.</p>
                      <p>What will happen over the next 20 years?<br/>
                          It will be amazing.<br/>
                          We want you to be part of this forthcoming change.<br/>
                          The possibilities are literally unbounded.<br/>
                          It is up to you to imagine, plane, create, and live your future.<br/>
                          We'd like to help you with this endeavour.

                    <h4 id="t1-2">Why The World Needs More Engineers</h4>
                    <div>
                      <p>Over the past 50 years, the world population has more than doubled - from 2.9 billion in 1958 to nearly 6.8 billion today (2010).</p>
                      <p>The expanding world population means increased demands on our water, energy and food supplies. This is the so-called sustainability problem that we on planet Earth face - a problem that has been receiving increasing attention on the national and international stage.</p>
                      <p>There are also concerns over depleting fossil fuel energy sources, global warming, clean energy, new disease spread patterns, and the variation in quality of life throughout the world. Engineers, no doubt, will significantly impact each of these areas.</p>
                      <p>Perhaps, more than ever before, the world needs more engineers.</p>
                      <p>Engineers that can work within and across multiple disciplines will be in particular demand. Why is this?</p>
                      <p>One example of this is the planned hypersonic vehicles. These vehicles (traveling Mach 5 - 20) will give us low cost, routine, reliable access to space.</p>
                      <p>Their development will involve most engineering disciplines:
                        <ul>
                          <li>Aerospace engineers for trajectory planning and aerodynamic load calculations</li>
                          <li>Structural and material engineers for the development of advanced thermally resistant light weight materials</li>
                          <li>Propulsion engineers for the development of scramjet engines</li>
                          <li>Control engineers for the development of automatic flight control systems</li>
                          <li>Electrical and computer engineers for the development of on-board computer and electronic systems</li>
                          <li>Mechanical and industrial engineers to design/evaluate robust manufacturing processes as well as conduct cost-benefits analysis</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                      <p>A similar type of list can be made for virtually any major forthcoming development (AAR, 2017):
