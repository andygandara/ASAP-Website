              <h5 id="1.1">1.1 About The Author</h5>
              <h6>Professional Background</h6>
              <p>Dr. Armando A. Rodriguez joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at Arizona State University (ASU) in 1990 – after receiving his doctorate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His area of specialization was control design for complex dynamical systems. He has worked/consulted at/for Army Research Laboratory, Boeing, Eglin Air Force Base, Honeywell, IBM, Bell Laboratories, MIT, National Academies, NSF, NASA Ames, NASA Langley, Raytheon Missile Systems. He has authored over 200 publications – including three texts: Analysis and Design of Feedback Control Systems, Analysis and Design of Linear Systems, and Analysis and Design of Multivariable Control Systems. He has given over 70 invited talks – including over 10 plenary talks.</p>
              <h6>Personal Biographical Background</h6>
              <p>His parents migrated to the U.S. in search of financial opportunity. He was born and raised in Washington Heights, New York City – a multicultural neighborhood bordering Harlem on its north side. Rodriguez is the oldest of three boys. His father was a window cleaner and handyman. His mother stayed home to take care of her three boys. His mother would pass away of cancer at the age of 44. Rodriguez was 13 years old. His brothers were 5 and 6 years old. This traumatic experience motivated him to excel in his studies. He is married to a lovely, hardworking accomplished engineer – the daughter of migrant field workers. Together, they are the proud parents of twins – a boy and a girl; great students; great kids; eager to become engineers so that they can create.</p>
              <h6>Awards</h6>
              <p>He is the recipient of an 1998 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science and Engineering Mentoring – receiving the award from President Bill Clinton in a White House oval office ceremony. He is also a Boeing A.D. Welliver Fellow (1996). He has received multiple teach and mentoring awards. He is currently the Executive Director of the Southwest Institute for Engineering Transfer Excellence (SWIETE) and the Motivated Engineering Transfer Student (METS) Center. He is working, with partners, toward the establishment of an Arizona-Wide and Southwest Regional Engineering Transfer Excellence Academy. Partnering institutions include:
                <ul>
                  <li>Mesa Community College, Estrella Mountain Community College, Phoenix College</li>
                  <li>Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, Mohave Community College, Yavapai College</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h6>Research Areas</h6>
              <p>His research interests lie in the following areas:

                  <li>how to best motivate, recruit, empower, train and place engineering students; working with community colleges across Arizona and the Southwest to maximally recruit and impact engineering bound students; toward an effective theory of quiz-based and project-based learning for STEM students, academic success and professional development (ASAP) strategies for engineering students – particularly community college transfer students</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h6>Application Areas</h6>
              <p>Application areas have included:
                <ul>
                  <li>intelligent autonomous systems and vehicles; driverless vehicles; robotic systems; drones; interacting systems; hypersonic vehicle design and control; guidance, navigation and control (GNC) for missiles; spacecraft design and control; power converters; lower power electronics; coordination of multiple ground and air vehicles in a highly uncertain environment; Modeling, Simulation, Animation and Real-Time (MoSART) control of dynamical systems; Flexible Autonomous Machines operating in an uncertain Environment (FAME); renewable energy; sustainability; and infrastructure management.
                      With students, he founded ASU’s Micro-Air Vehicle (MAV) club in 2015. He REALLY loves his job!</li>
                  <li>“When I was growing up in New York, I could never have possibly imagined all the opportunities that I would one day have. No way! My father gave me two choices: study or die. I am glad that eventually I chose correctly. My dad was glad too. Thanks dad! I owe so much to my mentors and teachers. I am supremely and forever grateful. Being able to give back is just one more gift that I could not have imagined.”</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

                </ul>
              </p>
              <h6>Ongoing Technological Revolution</h6>
              <p>The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented and accelerating technological revolution. We are seeing breakthroughs across many areas. These include:
                <ul>
                  <li>organ growth, organ and cell repair, DNA modification (via CRISPR), advanced new and personalized medicines, micro-and nano-technologies, driverless and driver assisted vehicles, swarms, exoskeletons, very high bandwidth communications, electronic miniaturization, supercomputing, smart grid, bio fuels, energy harvesting, advanced materials, and so much more!</li>
                </ul>
                To say that science and engineering controls the jobs of tomorrow is an egregious understatement.
              </p>
              <h6>Engineering as a Career</h6>
              <p>While engineering has often enjoyed a bad rep: hard, boring, irrelevant, and not having much to do with daily life; it is objectively exciting, very relevant, and has lots do with almost all aspects of daily life in today’s world. Is engineering hard? Here is the easy answer. Yes it is hard, but, then anything worthwhile is difficult. Here is the more correct nuanced answer. Hard relative to what? How many young people do you know that made optimally wrong choices – choices they will pay for over the next 50-60 years. It is sad to think about seriously. Here is the implicit reasoning that takes place:
                <ol>
                  <li>Do I study hard for 17-20 years and then reap the rewards (subject to some uncertainty) for the next 60 years? </li>
                  or
                  <li>Do I have some fun for 17-20 years and then work like a dog (with great uncertainty) for the next 60 years?</li>
                </ol>
                It is simply amazing to me why the majority chose door #2.
                It’s arguably worth the work when one properly evaluates the true return on investment (ROI) – financially, psychologically, socially and philosophically. “If I had to do it all over again, I would without any hesitation. How to get young people to see the inherent coolness of engineering is not easy, but it is a challenge I welcome. Objectively speaking, engineering is OUTRAGEOUSLY exciting, relevant and cool! For goodness sakes, its 2017 and we are growing organs in the lab. We are able to modify DNA, repair organs and clone a thing or two. The Kepler telescope has helped discovered over 3000 exoplanets. That’s a long ways from the 9 planet system I grow up admiring: My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles. I hated when they got rid of pickles. I want all young people to realize that there is ongoing technological revolution taking place – one that they can participate in. Like a mentor of mine taught me, it is a matter of planning your work and working your plan.”
              </p>
              <h6>Consequences of Quitting</h6>
              <p>If you start in Engineering, what are the consequences of quitting?<br/>
              They are almost incalculable. There is a cost to the nation, to you, to your future family. Dropping out of college costs the public billions. Read it for yourself:<br/>

              “Today, I am able to give my kids and family things that my parents could not have even imagined. I am not referring to physical things. Being able to properly educate your kids is the greatest gift a parent can experience.”
              </p>
              <h6>Preparing for an Increasingly Multidisciplinary Technological World</h6>
              <p>Lets save a little energy and drop the silly quotes. I urge all young people to prepare for an increasingly multidisciplinary and technologically advanced world. The possibilities (from an imagination perspective) are, for all practical purposes, boundless.</p>

              <h5 id="1.4">1.4 Taking Responsibility - It's Your Future</h5>
              <p>A university education is special. It is a special time. Here is something to remember:<br/>
                  <i>"School is not about learning. It is about Learning to Learn (A.A. Rodriguez, 2012)."</i><br/>
                  It is amazing that universities offer all these amazing classes, but there is not class where you are taught how to learn. This is truly amazing. 
                  Toward this end, I want to recommend the following:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="http://www.guaranteed4.com" target="_blank">Guaranteed 4.0 Learning System – by Dr. Donna O. Johnson</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/make-it-stick-peter-c-brown/1117254682/2691605415481?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_Marketplace+Shopping+greatbookprices_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP24007&k_clickid=3x24007" target="_blank">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning – by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel</a></li>

                </ul>
              </p>
              <h6>Setting Priorities and Remaining Disciplined</h6>
              <p>As you move forward, you must force yourself to prioritize widely and remain disciplined. Try not to celebrate too early.</p>
              <h6>Life-Long Friendships, Role Models, Mentors</h6>
              <p>You will develop life-long friendships while in school. Be aware of this. Nurture them. Along your journey, you will encounter role models and mentors – some wrapped in the same humanoidal package.</p>
              <h6>Reaching Out for Help</h6>
              <p>Learn to reach out for help. Too many students remain silent during there 4-5 year stay at the university. Don’t let this happen to you. Ask lots of questions. (Think before you ask…but…for heaven sakes, ASK!)</p>
              <h6>The Difference Between an Academic Advisor and a Mentor </h6>
              <p>While an academic advisor can talk to you about classes, a mentor can help you plan your path toward a wonderful career and life. Get yourself several mentors. Just as there are should be different types of tools in your toolbox, you ought to have different types of mentors. Start collecting them. You will find good use for each of your mentors. If you search properly, you can find one that is like a Swiss army knife!</p>
              <h6>Need for Academic and Career Plans - These are Vital to Keep You on Course!</h6>
              <p>As you move from semester to semester, make sure that you form and update your academic and career plans. Each update should involve deep thinking, dreaming, reflecting, planning, goal and objective setting – all dosed in reality. If you do this, the plans will keep you on course.</p>

              <div>
                <p>We all know that engineers play a significant role in shaping the world we live in. Engineers are responsible (in part) for the ongoing technological revolution that the world is experiencing.</p>
                <p>Without engineers, many (if not most) of the technology we use day-in and day-out would not exist.</p>
                <p>Engineers are critical toward achieving and maintaining a high standard of living. As technology continues to advance, we expect living standards around the world to significantly improve. Billions should benefit from this advance.</p>
                <p>Engineers are innovators that discover and design ways to significantly enhance all areas of people's lives. These areas include advanced:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Transportation systems</li>
                    <li>Communication systems</li>
                    <li>Computer systems</li>
                    <li>Health and medical diagnostic and surgical systems</li>
                    <li>Personalized medicine</li>
                    <li>Clean energy solutions</li>
                    <li>Environmental solutions</li>
                    <li>Automation</li>
                    <li>Robotic systems</li>
                    <li>Mass asynchronous learning environments</li>
                    <li>Air, land, sea, and cyber defense systems</li>
                    <li>Space and underwater exploration systems</li>
                  </ul>
                  And much more.
                </p>
                <p>Engineers make our lives easier, safer and better.</p>
                <p>Engineers create technology, infrastructure, processes, materials, devices and systems that we use every day. Engineers are responsible for the development of many "products." These include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Medical devices that save lives (e.g. pace makers, defibrillators, medicine dispensers, artificial limbs and organs)</li>
                    <li>Communication/computing devices and systems (e.g. smart cell phones, powerful desktop and laptop computers, PDAs, the internet)</li>
                    <li>Advanced transportation systems (e.g. hybrid vehicles, magnetically levitated trains, hypersonic aircraft)</li>
                    <li>Advanced robotic systems (e.g. on manufacturing lines, for delicate surgical procedures)</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Engineers have dramatically shaped the world. Here's some of their major accomplishments:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Computers</li>
                    <li>The Internet</li>
                    <li>Spacecraft</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>In just the last 100 years, many revolutionary changes have taken place. During this short period, we've gone from primitive communications to instant world wide multimedia communications; airplanes that fly 40 mph to airplanes that fly 10 times the speed of sound (<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/x43-main.html" target="_blank">link to X-43A Mach 10 Flight</a>) - a truly amazing feat.</p>
                <p>What will happen over the next 20 years?<br/>
                    It will be amazing.<br/>
                    We want you to be part of this forthcoming change.<br/>
                    The possibilities are literally unbounded.<br/>
                    It is up to you to imagine, plane, create, and live your future.<br/>
                    We'd like to help you with this endeavour.

              <h5 id="t1-2">Why The World Needs More Engineers</h5>
              <div>
                <p>Over the past 50 years, the world population has more than doubled - from 2.9 billion in 1958 to nearly 6.8 billion today (2010).</p>
                <p>The expanding world population means increased demands on our water, energy and food supplies. This is the so-called sustainability problem that we on planet Earth face - a problem that has been receiving increasing attention on the national and international stage.</p>
                <p>There are also concerns over depleting fossil fuel energy sources, global warming, clean energy, new disease spread patterns, and the variation in quality of life throughout the world. Engineers, no doubt, will significantly impact each of these areas.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, more than ever before, the world needs more engineers.</p>
                <p>Engineers that can work within and across multiple disciplines will be in particular demand. Why is this?</p>
                <p>One example of this is the planned hypersonic vehicles. These vehicles (traveling Mach 5 - 20) will give us low cost, routine, reliable access to space.</p>
                <p>Their development will involve most engineering disciplines:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Aerospace engineers for trajectory planning and aerodynamic load calculations</li>
                    <li>Structural and material engineers for the development of advanced thermally resistant light weight materials</li>
                    <li>Propulsion engineers for the development of scramjet engines</li>
                    <li>Control engineers for the development of automatic flight control systems</li>
                    <li>Electrical and computer engineers for the development of on-board computer and electronic systems</li>
                    <li>Mechanical and industrial engineers to design/evaluate robust manufacturing processes as well as conduct cost-benefits analysis</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>A similar type of list can be made for virtually any major forthcoming development (AAR, 2017):

              <h4 id="t3">The Ideal Job</h4>
              <h5 id="t3-1">STEM Career Paths: Technical vs Management</h5>
              <div>
                <p>At some point, you will need to decide if you wish to pursue a technical pathway or a managerial pathway. While this should be seriously addressed before and during your Masters degree – yes I said and met Maters degree – it is important to start thinking about this as soon as possible. I generally advise people to stay as technical as possible for a long as possible. Why? Hi-tech companies need and will continue to rely on brain power. I also advise them to deeply understand what their companies do!!!! By so doing, they can really participate. Without that deep understanding, they risk not knowing how their work really fits in. This is dangerous because it can lead to them being replaced. Not seeing it coming is awful! Keep learning. Life-Long Learning is important. These are not just a few buzz words to fill a page.</p>
                <p>Life-Long Learning is critical for you and your family to have real security.</p>
                <p>Of course, such companies need talented management to lead, guide, assist and support their technical groups and see opportunities for the company. You will have to decide which pathway you wish to pursue. Do you want to be a technical leader or a people manager. You will need to decide. This should not be an overnight decision. It should take years to arrive at your final decision. You just need to carefully do your homework. There’s lots of the homework you will need to do. Much of it will involve figuring yourself out! This can be challenging for many. The sooner you become a practitioner of critical thinking, the better off you, and those around you, will be.</p>
                <p>In some companies, an MBA may be essential to rise in the management ranks. There’s lots of home work to be done here…in order to do things properly. What is an IDEAL JOB? First, we all know that it simply doesn’t exist. What do I mean? Every job has pros and cons. However, with proper preparation (and yes….a little luck), you can come close; i.e. maximizing the pros and minimizing the cons.</p>
              </div>
              <h5 id="t3-2">Salary &amp; Benefits</h5>

                  <li>Salary Considerations: initial salary, raises, bonuses, promotions, stock options, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                Think hard about the benefits, not just the salary!
