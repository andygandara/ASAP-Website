                      With students, he founded ASU’s Micro-Air Vehicle (MAV) club in 2015. He REALLY loves his job!</li>
                  <li>“When I was growing up in New York, I could never have possibly imagined all the opportunities that I would one day have. No way! My father gave me two choices: study or die. I am glad that eventually I chose correctly. My dad was glad too. Thanks dad! I owe so much to my mentors and teachers. I am supremely and forever grateful. Being able to give back is just one more gift that I could not have imagined.”</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <h5 id="1.2">1.2 Historical Perspective - The Need for a Highly Trained STEM Workforce</h5>
              <h6>Post World War II</h6>
              <p>After WWII, U.S. leadership recognized the need for excelling and maintaining a global edge in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).</p>
              <h6>National Science Board (NSB) and National Science Foundation (NSF)</h6>
              <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation" target="_blank">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a> was formed in 1950. Today, its budget is approximately $7.46B per year (2016).</p>
              <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Board" target="_blank">U.S. National Science Board</a> serves as the policy generator for the NSF. It also serves as an advisory body to the President and Congress. As such, the NSB and NSF work to address the strategic needs of the U.S. in science, engineering and educations.</p>
              <h6>STEM Workforce Statistics</h6>
              <p>U.S. STEM workforce statistics are well documented within the NSB’s Science and Engineering Indicators:
                <ul>
                  <li>2016: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsb20161/#/" target="_blank">National Science Board SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INDICATORS 2016</a></li>

                </ul>
              </p>
              <h6>Ongoing Technological Revolution</h6>
              <p>The world is currently experiencing an unprecedented and accelerating technological revolution. We are seeing breakthroughs across many areas. These include:
                <ul>
                  <li>organ growth, organ and cell repair, DNA modification (via CRISPR), advanced new and personalized medicines, micro-and nano-technologies, driverless and driver assisted vehicles, swarms, exoskeletons, very high bandwidth communications, electronic miniaturization, supercomputing, smart grid, bio fuels, energy harvesting, advanced materials, and so much more!</li>
                </ul>
                To say that science and engineering controls the jobs of tomorrow is an egregious understatement.
              </p>
              <h6>Engineering as a Career</h6>
              <p>While engineering has often enjoyed a bad rep: hard, boring, irrelevant, and not having much to do with daily life; it is objectively exciting, very relevant, and has lots do with almost all aspects of daily life in today’s world. Is engineering hard? Here is the easy answer. Yes it is hard, but, then anything worthwhile is difficult. Here is the more correct nuanced answer. Hard relative to what? How many young people do you know that made optimally wrong choices – choices they will pay for over the next 50-60 years. It is sad to think about seriously. Here is the implicit reasoning that takes place:
                <ol>
                  <li>Do I study hard for 17-20 years and then reap the rewards (subject to some uncertainty) for the next 60 years? </li>
                  or
                  <li>Do I have some fun for 17-20 years and then work like a dog (with great uncertainty) for the next 60 years?</li>
                </ol>
                It is simply amazing to me why the majority chose door #2.
                It’s arguably worth the work when one properly evaluates the true return on investment (ROI) – financially, psychologically, socially and philosophically. “If I had to do it all over again, I would without any hesitation. How to get young people to see the inherent coolness of engineering is not easy, but it is a challenge I welcome. Objectively speaking, engineering is OUTRAGEOUSLY exciting, relevant and cool! For goodness sakes, its 2017 and we are growing organs in the lab. We are able to modify DNA, repair organs and clone a thing or two. The Kepler telescope has helped discovered over 3000 exoplanets. That’s a long ways from the 9 planet system I grow up admiring: My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pickles. I hated when they got rid of pickles. I want all young people to realize that there is ongoing technological revolution taking place – one that they can participate in. Like a mentor of mine taught me, it is a matter of planning your work and working your plan.”

              <p>If you start in Engineering, what are the consequences of quitting?<br/>
              They are almost incalculable. There is a cost to the nation, to you, to your future family. Dropping out of college costs the public billions. Read it for yourself:<br/>

              “Today, I am able to give my kids and family things that my parents could not have even imagined. I am not referring to physical things. Being able to properly educate your kids is the greatest gift a parent can experience.”

              <h6>Preparing for an Increasingly Multidisciplinary Technological World</h6>
              <p>Lets save a little energy and drop the silly quotes. I urge all young people to prepare for an increasingly multidisciplinary and technologically advanced world. The possibilities (from an imagination perspective) are, for all practical purposes, boundless.</p>
              <h6>The Purpose of this Site</h6>
              <p>The purpose of this site is simple: to help you take control of your academics, your mind, your career and all aspects of your life.</p>

              <h5 id="1.4">1.4 Taking Responsibility - It's Your Future</h5>
              <p>A university education is special. It is a special time. Here is something to remember:<br/>
                  <i>"School is not about learning. It is about Learning to Learn (A.A. Rodriguez, 2012)."</i><br/>
                  It is amazing that universities offer all these amazing classes, but there is not class where you are taught how to learn. This is truly amazing. 
                  Toward this end, I want to recommend the following:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="http://www.guaranteed4.com" target="_blank">Guaranteed 4.0 Learning System – by Dr. Donna O. Johnson</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/make-it-stick-peter-c-brown/1117254682/2691605415481?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_Marketplace+Shopping+greatbookprices_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP24007&k_clickid=3x24007" target="_blank">Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning – by Peter C. Brown, Henry L. Roediger III, Mark A. McDaniel</a></li>
                  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Thinking-Taking-Charge-Learning-ebook/dp/B008UFWW0I" target="_blank">Critical Thinking: Tools for Taking Charge of Your Learning and Your Life – by Richard Paul and Linda Elder</a></li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <h6>Setting Priorities and Remaining Disciplined</h6>
              <p>As you move forward, you must force yourself to prioritize widely and remain disciplined. Try not to celebrate too early.</p>
              <h6>Life-Long Friendships, Role Models, Mentors</h6>
              <p>You will develop life-long friendships while in school. Be aware of this. Nurture them. Along your journey, you will encounter role models and mentors – some wrapped in the same humanoidal package.</p>
              <h6>Reaching Out for Help</h6>
              <p>Learn to reach out for help. Too many students remain silent during there 4-5 year stay at the university. Don’t let this happen to you. Ask lots of questions. (Think before you ask…but…for heaven sakes, ASK!)</p>
              <h6>The Difference Between an Academic Advisor and a Mentor </h6>
              <p>While an academic advisor can talk to you about classes, a mentor can help you plan your path toward a wonderful career and life. Get yourself several mentors. Just as there are should be different types of tools in your toolbox, you ought to have different types of mentors. Start collecting them. You will find good use for each of your mentors. If you search properly, you can find one that is like a Swiss army knife!</p>
              <h6>Need for Academic and Career Plans - These are Vital to Keep You on Course!</h6>
              <p>As you move from semester to semester, make sure that you form and update your academic and career plans. Each update should involve deep thinking, dreaming, reflecting, planning, goal and objective setting – all dosed in reality. If you do this, the plans will keep you on course.</p>

              <h5 id="1.6">1.6 Acknowledgements</h5>
              <p>I wish to thank my wife, my kids, my family for all their support. I also wish to thank my colleagues for their professionalism, spirit, curiosity and friendship. Finally, I must thank the students. They make everything possible. They represent our future leaders. It is a pleasure to work with them. Oh yes. I also wish to thank the National Science Foundation for NSF S-STEM 1565177. We will make good use of it.</p>
